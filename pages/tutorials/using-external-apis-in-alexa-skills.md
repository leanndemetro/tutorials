Navigate to your downloads folder, and open unzip the template zip file. Open it within the text editor of your choice. 

Now, head to amazon.developer.com, select the alexa tab, and from the dropdown menu in the top right corner, select Alexa Developer Console. Now, click create new skill. 

Give your skill the desired name, under Choose a model to add to your skill, select custom, and under choose a method to host your skill's backend resources, select Alexa-hosted (Node.js). Scroll up and click create skill, then select start from scratch.

Now, head back the developer console and look under the interaction model tab and select the JSON editor.

Head back to your downloaded template and under the models directory open the file called en-US.json. Copy it's contents. Return to the amazon developer console JSON editors, delete it's contents and replace them with the JSON copied from the en-US.JSON file. Click save model, and then build model.

Return to your template file within your text editor, head to lamba/custom/index.js and copy it's contents. Return now to the developer console and select the code tab from the navigation bar. Replace the contents of the index.js file at this location with the copied code from your template. Select save, and then deploy.

Be sure to take note of the await getRemoteData function on line 15, this is where an address to an API can be passed in to return the data of your choice.
